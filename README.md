> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**: Due to NDA restrictions, this repository provides only a high-level overview of the project. Proprietary data, code, and certain implementation details cannot be shared.  

## üìñ Project Overview  
This project focused on **unlocking personalized treatment strategies** for obesity and diabetes by analyzing large-scale clinical, behavioral, and genomic data.  

- Worked with **10K+ patient datasets** spanning **500+ parameters** and totaling over **6M records**, including:  
  - Body composition metrics  
  - Blood test profiles  
  - Diet logs  
  - Behavior surveys  
  - other Electronic Medical Records (EMR) and Electronic Health Records (EHR)  

- Leveraged **statistical analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning** to identify the most influential factors during **low-carb dietary interventions**.  
- Delivered reproducible pipelines and models that scaled from research to real-world applications.
